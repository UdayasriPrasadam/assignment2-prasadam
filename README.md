### Kerala Folklore Museum

I am interested in the arts. The folklore museum in Kerala is famous for providing art education to students and visual knowledge to art lovers and researchers. It treasures the trove of stone, sculptures, stone Age objects, jewelry, paintings, musical instruments, and folk art. This ethnic museum has the essence of life and culture over the past 1000 years.
